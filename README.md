# Adevent of Code 2021 - On a NES
Dumbest fucking idea I've had to date. I am not enjoying this even remotely. At this point it is just a compulsive nightmarish obsession to complete the stupid challenge.

![AoC 2021](intro.png)

Should (and does) run an unmodified NES, using MMC1 with 0x2000 (+0x800) bytes of RAM. Some of the challenges take waaay over an hour to compute the answer for... Doesn't work with PowerPAK (dont know why and at this point, I dont care). Does work natively otherwise.

If you hate yourself and want to watch it for the serveral hours it takes to complete, just:
1) `(cd nesasmsrc && gcc *.c -o ../nesasm-fix)` to build the modified (required) nesasm version.
2) `./build.sh`
3) Run it and wait several hours for the hot garbage to finish. Tune is pretty cool though, ripped from: $INSERT_URL.
