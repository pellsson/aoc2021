# Adevent of Code 2021 - On an NES
Dumbest fucking idea I've had to date. I am not enjoying this even remotely. At this point it is just a compulsive nightmarish obsession to complete the stupid challenge.

![AoC 2021](intro.png)

Should (and does) run an on an unmodified NES. Uses MMC1 with 0x2000 (+0x800) bytes of RAM. Some of the challenges take **way** over an hour to compute the answer for. Does **not** work with PowerPAK (dont know why and at this point, I dont care). Does work on physical hardware.

If you hate yourself and want to watch it for the serveral hours it takes to complete, just:

1) `(cd nesasmsrc && gcc *.c -o ../nesasm-fix)` to build the modified (required) nesasm version.
2) `./build.sh`
3) Run it and wait a short eternity for the hot garbage to finish. Tune is pretty cool though, ripped from: $INSERT_URL. However, the mustic does not loop so the vast majority of execution is spent in silent anguish.

**EDIT:** I just added the ROM image...

Wow, fun. Simple. This will be a breeze. I'll add music and a title screen. Holy shit so much fun.

Still fun. Not much to add.
